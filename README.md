## `Responsive Navbar`

**Built using React**

Two **useRef Hook** were created to depict the links container and\ the links. The height of the links were obtained using the\
**.current.getBoundingClientRect()** method on the Ref container.\ The obtained heights are added up to set the height of container \ housing the links. This allows for dynamic height setting of the \ container without having to adjust value from the **index.css**.

**NOTE: The links have no functionality in this repo**
